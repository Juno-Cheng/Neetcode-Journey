# Sliding Window

## Overview

This section covers the sliding window technique, an efficient algorithmic pattern for solving problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings by maintaining a window that slides across the data structure.

## Topics

### Sliding Window Fixed Size
Advanced Algorithms

Fixed-size sliding window maintains a constant window size as it moves through the array or string. This technique is ideal for problems requiring analysis of all subarrays or substrings of a specific length, such as finding maximum sums or averages in fixed-size windows. The approach eliminates the need for nested loops, achieving O(n) time complexity.

### Sliding Window Variable Size
Advanced Algorithms

Variable-size sliding window dynamically expands and contracts based on problem constraints. This technique is essential for finding optimal subarrays or substrings that satisfy specific conditions, such as longest substrings with unique characters or minimum-size subarrays with a target sum. The window adjusts its boundaries efficiently to explore all valid solutions.
