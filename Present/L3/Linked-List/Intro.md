# Linked List

## Overview

This section covers linked list data structures and advanced pointer techniques for efficient traversal and manipulation of node-based data structures.

## Topics

### Singly Linked Lists
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Singly linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. This fundamental structure enables dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations. Understanding singly linked lists is essential for mastering pointer manipulation and recursive algorithms.

### Doubly Linked Lists
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Doubly linked lists extend singly linked lists by including pointers to both the next and previous nodes. This bidirectional structure allows traversal in both directions and provides more flexibility for insertion and deletion operations. Doubly linked lists are particularly useful when backward traversal is required.

### Fast and Slow Pointers
Advanced Algorithms

The fast and slow pointers technique uses two pointers moving at different speeds through a linked list to solve complex problems efficiently. This approach is essential for detecting cycles, finding the middle node, and determining if a linked list is a palindrome. The technique reduces time complexity while maintaining O(1) space complexity.
