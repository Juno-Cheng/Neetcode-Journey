# Binary Search

## Overview

This section covers binary search algorithms for efficiently locating elements and ranges in sorted data structures.

## Topics

### Search Array
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Binary search in arrays efficiently finds a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. This technique reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(log n), making it essential for searching in large sorted datasets.

### Search Range
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Search range extends binary search to find the leftmost and rightmost positions of a target value in a sorted array. This technique is crucial for handling duplicate elements and solving problems that require finding the boundaries of a value's occurrence.
