Advanced Algorithms

The two pointers technique uses two indices that traverse a data structure either toward each other or in the same direction to solve problems more efficiently. This approach is particularly effective for sorted arrays, finding pairs, sliding window problems, and linked list operations. Understanding when and how to apply two pointers can reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) for many problems.
