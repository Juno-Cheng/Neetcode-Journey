# Stack

## Overview

This section covers the stack data structure and its applications in algorithmic problem-solving.

## Topics

### Stacks
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, making them ideal for problems involving nested structures, expression evaluation, and backtracking. Understanding stack operations and their time complexities is essential for solving many coding interview problems.
