# Math & Geometry

## Overview

This section covers mathematical algorithms and geometric problem-solving techniques essential for solving problems involving number theory, coordinate geometry, and computational mathematics.

## Topics

### GCD and LCM
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) are fundamental number theory concepts used in many algorithmic problems. The Euclidean algorithm efficiently computes GCD, while LCM can be derived from GCD. Understanding these concepts is essential for solving problems involving fractions, modular arithmetic, and number relationships.

### Prime Numbers
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Prime number problems involve identifying primes, generating prime lists, and using prime factorization. Techniques like the Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently find all primes up to a given limit. Understanding prime number properties and algorithms is crucial for solving problems involving divisibility, factorization, and number theory.

### Coordinate Geometry
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Coordinate geometry problems involve working with points, lines, distances, and shapes in 2D or 3D space. These problems require understanding distance formulas, slope calculations, and geometric relationships. Mastering coordinate geometry is essential for solving problems involving spatial relationships, pathfinding, and geometric computations.

### Number Theory
Advanced Algorithms

Number theory problems involve advanced mathematical concepts like modular arithmetic, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and number properties. These problems often require mathematical insights and efficient algorithms to handle large numbers. Understanding number theory is crucial for solving complex mathematical optimization problems.
