# Greedy

## Overview

This section covers greedy algorithms, which make locally optimal choices at each step to find a global optimum, and Kadane's algorithm, an efficient technique for solving maximum subarray problems.

## Topics

### Greedy
Advanced Algorithms

Greedy algorithms solve optimization problems by making the best choice at each step without reconsidering previous decisions. This approach works efficiently for problems where local optimization leads to global optimization, such as activity selection, fractional knapsack, and minimum spanning trees. Understanding when greedy strategies are applicable and when they fail is crucial for solving many algorithmic problems efficiently.

### Kadane's Algorithm
Advanced Algorithms

Kadane's algorithm finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in O(n) time using dynamic programming principles. The algorithm maintains the maximum sum ending at the current position and updates the global maximum, efficiently solving problems that would otherwise require O(n²) or O(n³) approaches. Mastering Kadane's algorithm is essential for solving maximum subarray problems and related optimization challenges.
