# 2-D Dynamic Programming

## Overview

This section covers two-dimensional dynamic programming, which extends 1D DP to solve problems involving two variables or dimensions, such as grids, sequences, and optimization problems with multiple constraints.

## Topics

### 2-Dimension DP
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Two-dimensional dynamic programming uses a 2D table to store solutions to subproblems with two variables. This approach is essential for problems involving grids, matrix paths, and problems where the state depends on two parameters. Understanding 2D DP patterns is fundamental for solving complex optimization problems that cannot be solved with 1D DP.

### 0 / 1 Knapsack
Advanced Algorithms

The 0/1 knapsack problem involves selecting items with given weights and values to maximize value without exceeding a weight capacity, where each item can be taken at most once. This classic DP problem demonstrates how to build solutions by considering whether to include or exclude each item. Mastering 0/1 knapsack is crucial for solving many optimization problems involving resource allocation and selection constraints.

### Unbounded Knapsack
Advanced Algorithms

Unbounded knapsack allows taking each item multiple times, unlike 0/1 knapsack where items can only be taken once. This variation requires different state transitions and is essential for problems involving unlimited resources or repeated selections. Understanding unbounded knapsack patterns is crucial for solving coin change problems and similar optimization challenges.

### LCS
Advanced Algorithms

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences, where a subsequence maintains relative order but not necessarily contiguity. This fundamental string DP problem demonstrates how to compare sequences and build solutions incrementally. Mastering LCS is essential for solving problems involving sequence comparison, edit distance, and string alignment.
