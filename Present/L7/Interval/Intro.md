# Interval

## Overview

This section covers interval problems, which involve working with ranges of values and solving problems related to overlapping intervals, merging intervals, and interval scheduling.

## Topics

### Merge Intervals
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Merge intervals problems involve combining overlapping or adjacent intervals into consolidated ranges. This fundamental technique requires sorting intervals and then iterating through them to detect overlaps and merge when necessary. Understanding merge intervals is essential for solving problems involving time ranges, scheduling conflicts, and range consolidation.

### Insert Interval
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Insert interval problems require adding a new interval into a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals, merging when necessary. This technique involves finding the correct insertion position and handling overlaps with existing intervals. Mastering interval insertion is crucial for maintaining sorted interval collections and solving dynamic scheduling problems.

### Non-overlapping Intervals
Advanced Algorithms

Non-overlapping intervals problems involve finding the maximum number of intervals that don't overlap or removing the minimum number of intervals to make all remaining intervals non-overlapping. These problems require greedy algorithms and careful consideration of interval endpoints. Understanding non-overlapping interval techniques is essential for optimization problems involving resource allocation and scheduling.

### Meeting Rooms
Advanced Algorithms

Meeting rooms problems determine whether given intervals can be scheduled without conflicts or find the minimum number of rooms needed to accommodate all meetings. These problems combine interval overlap detection with greedy algorithms or priority queues. Mastering meeting rooms problems is crucial for solving real-world scheduling and resource allocation challenges.
