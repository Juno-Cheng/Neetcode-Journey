# Bit Manipulation

## Overview

This section covers bit manipulation techniques for efficiently working with binary representations of numbers, enabling powerful optimizations and compact data representations.

## Topics

### Bit Operations
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Bit operations manipulate individual bits in binary representations using operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts. These fundamental operations enable efficient implementations of algorithms, compact data structures, and optimizations that would be difficult with standard arithmetic. Understanding bit operations is essential for solving problems involving flags, masks, and low-level optimizations.
