# BackTracking

## Overview

This section covers backtracking algorithms, a systematic method for exploring all possible solutions to problems by building candidates incrementally and abandoning paths that cannot lead to valid solutions.

## Topics

### Tree Maze
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Tree maze problems involve finding paths through tree structures or grid-based mazes using backtracking. This fundamental technique teaches how to explore all possible paths, mark visited nodes, and backtrack when reaching dead ends. Understanding tree maze problems is essential for grasping the core backtracking pattern of making choices, exploring, and undoing choices.

### Subsets
Advanced Algorithms

Subsets problems require generating all possible subsets of a given set using backtracking. This technique systematically builds subsets by including or excluding each element, exploring all combinations without repetition. Mastering subset generation is crucial for solving problems involving power sets, subset sums, and combinatorial selection.

### Combinations
Advanced Algorithms

Combinations problems involve selecting k elements from n elements where order does not matter. Backtracking efficiently generates all valid combinations by building candidates incrementally and pruning invalid paths early. This technique is essential for problems requiring selection of elements that satisfy specific constraints.

### Permutations
Advanced Algorithms

Permutations problems require generating all possible arrangements of elements where order matters. Backtracking systematically explores all ordering possibilities by swapping elements and backtracking when constraints are violated. Understanding permutation generation is fundamental for solving problems involving arrangements, sequences, and ordering constraints.
