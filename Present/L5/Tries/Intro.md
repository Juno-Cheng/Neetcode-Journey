# Trie

## Overview

This section covers the trie data structure, an advanced tree-based structure optimized for efficient string storage, retrieval, and prefix matching operations.

## Topics

### Trie
Advanced Algorithms

A trie, also known as a prefix tree, stores strings as nodes where each path from root to leaf represents a string. This structure enables efficient prefix searches, autocomplete functionality, and string matching with O(m) time complexity where m is the string length. Tries are essential for problems involving dictionary lookups, IP routing, and text processing applications where prefix-based queries are common.
