# Graphs

## Overview

This section covers graph data structures and fundamental graph traversal algorithms essential for solving problems involving networks, relationships, and connectivity.

## Topics

### Intro to Graphs
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Graphs are fundamental data structures consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Understanding graph representation, types (directed, undirected, weighted), and basic properties is essential for solving problems involving networks, social connections, and hierarchical relationships. Graphs provide the foundation for many advanced algorithms in computer science.

### Matrix DFS
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Matrix DFS applies depth-first search to two-dimensional grids, exploring adjacent cells recursively to solve problems like finding paths, counting islands, or exploring connected regions. This technique is essential for grid-based problems where you need to traverse all reachable cells from a starting point, marking visited cells to avoid cycles.

### Matrix BFS
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Matrix BFS uses breadth-first search on two-dimensional grids, exploring cells level by level using a queue. This technique is crucial for finding shortest paths in unweighted grids, flood fill problems, and scenarios where you need to process cells in order of their distance from the starting point. BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### Adjacency List
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Adjacency lists represent graphs as arrays of lists, where each vertex stores its connected neighbors. This space-efficient representation is ideal for sparse graphs and enables efficient traversal and neighbor access. Understanding adjacency list representation is fundamental for implementing graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms.
