# 1-D Dynamic Programming

## Overview

This section covers one-dimensional dynamic programming, a technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid redundant calculations.

## Topics

### 1-Dimension DP
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

One-dimensional dynamic programming uses a single array to store solutions to subproblems, building up the solution incrementally. This fundamental approach is essential for problems like Fibonacci sequences, climbing stairs, and coin change where each state depends on previous states. Understanding 1D DP patterns is the foundation for mastering more complex multi-dimensional DP problems.

### Palindromes
Advanced Algorithms

Palindrome problems in dynamic programming involve determining if strings or substrings are palindromes and finding the longest palindromic subsequence or substring. These problems require careful state definition and transition, often combining DP with string manipulation techniques. Mastering palindrome DP problems is crucial for solving complex string-based optimization challenges.
