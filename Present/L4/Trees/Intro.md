# Trees

## Overview

This section covers tree data structures, binary search trees, and fundamental tree traversal algorithms essential for solving hierarchical and search-based problems.

## Topics

### BST Insert and Remove
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Binary Search Tree insertion and removal operations maintain the BST property where left children are smaller and right children are larger than their parent. Understanding these fundamental operations is crucial for building and maintaining sorted tree structures efficiently.

### Depth-First Search
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Depth-First Search traverses trees by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This recursive or stack-based approach is fundamental for tree traversal, path finding, and solving problems that require exploring all nodes in a specific order.

### Breadth-First Search
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Breadth-First Search explores trees level by level using a queue, visiting all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level. This technique is essential for finding shortest paths, level-order traversals, and problems requiring processing nodes by their distance from the root.

### BST Sets and Maps
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Binary Search Trees serve as the foundation for implementing set and map data structures, providing efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Understanding how BSTs enable these abstract data types is crucial for solving problems requiring ordered collections with fast access.

### Iterative DFS
Advanced Algorithms

Iterative Depth-First Search implements DFS using an explicit stack instead of recursion, providing better control over traversal and avoiding stack overflow issues in deep trees. This technique is essential for solving problems where recursive solutions are impractical or when explicit stack manipulation is required.
