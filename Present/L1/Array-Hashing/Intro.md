# Array-Hashing

## Overview

This section covers fundamental array and hashing techniques essential for solving algorithmic problems.

## Topics

### Dynamic Arrays
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Dynamic arrays provide flexible storage that can grow or shrink as needed. Understanding their implementation and time complexity characteristics is crucial for efficient problem-solving.

### Hash Usage
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Hash tables enable O(1) average-case lookups, insertions, and deletions. Learning when and how to use hash maps and hash sets is fundamental for optimizing solutions.

### Hash Implementation
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Understanding how hash functions work, collision handling strategies, and the internal mechanics of hash tables provides deeper insight into their performance characteristics.

### Prefix Sums
Advanced Algorithms

Prefix sums allow efficient range sum queries and are useful for problems involving cumulative operations, subarray sums, and related computations.
