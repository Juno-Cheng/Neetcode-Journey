# NeetCode Intro.md Standards

## General Guidelines
- Keep content brief and concise
- No emojis in any Intro.md files
- Maintain consistent structure across all Intro.md files
- Use clear, professional language
- Focus on essential information only

## File Structure Template

All Intro.md files must follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Topic Name]

## Overview

[Brief 1-2 sentence description of what this section covers]

## Topics

### [Topic Name]
[Difficulty Level]

[2-3 sentence description explaining the topic, its importance, and key concepts]

[Repeat for each topic if multiple topics exist]

## Resources

- [Resource Name - Source](https://link-to-resource.com)
- [Another Resource - Source](https://link-to-resource.com)
```

## Section Requirements

### Title (H1)
- Use the exact topic name as the title
- Capitalize appropriately (e.g., "Two Pointers", "Array-Hashing", "Stack")
- No additional formatting or punctuation

### Overview Section
- Must be 1-2 sentences
- Describe what the section covers at a high level
- Keep it general and introductory

### Topics Section
- Each topic should be a level 3 heading (###)
- Immediately after the heading, include the difficulty level on its own line:
  - "Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners"
  - "Advanced Algorithms"
- Follow with 2-3 sentences describing:
  - What the topic is
  - Why it's important
  - Key concepts or applications
- Keep descriptions concise and informative

### Resources Section
- Always include a Resources section
- Format links as: `- [Resource Name - Source](URL)`
- Include resource name, source (typically GeeksforGeeks), and URL
- Search for relevant online resources when creating Intro.md files
- Prioritize authoritative sources (GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, etc.)
- Include 3-5 relevant resources per topic

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use present tense
- Be direct and informative
- Avoid fluff or unnecessary words
- Focus on practical applications and importance

### Difficulty Levels
Use these exact phrases:
- "Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners" - for beginner topics
- "Advanced Algorithms" - for advanced topics

### Resource Links
- Always search for relevant online resources
- Prefer GeeksforGeeks for DSA topics
- Include links to:
  - Main tutorial pages
  - Topic-specific guides
  - Applications and use cases
  - General DSA tutorials when relevant

## Example Structure

```markdown
# Stack

## Overview

This section covers the stack data structure and its applications in algorithmic problem-solving.

## Topics

### Stacks
Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, making them ideal for problems involving nested structures, expression evaluation, and backtracking. Understanding stack operations and their time complexities is essential for solving many coding interview problems.

```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency** - Follow the exact structure shown in examples
2. **Brevity** - Keep descriptions short and to the point
3. **Clarity** - Use clear, simple language
4. **Completeness** - Always include Overview, Topics, and Resources sections
5. **Relevance** - Ensure resources are directly related to the topic
6. **No Emojis** - Never include emojis in any Intro.md file
7. **Search First** - Always search for relevant online resources before creating Resources section
