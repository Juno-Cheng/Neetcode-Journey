#================== Lambda Practice
'''
Problem: Transform to Dictionary
Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name followed by a score, use a lambda function to transform this list into a dictionary where each key is the name, and the value is the score multiplied by 10 if the score is below 5, and by 5 otherwise.

Example Input: [("Alice", 4), ("Bob", 6), ("Charlie", 2)]
Expected Output: {"Alice": 40, "Bob": 30, "Charlie": 20}
